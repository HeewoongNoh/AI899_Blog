## [Paper 1] Drug Discovery with Dynamic Goal-aware Fragments


### Introduction

As far, drug discovery has been developed for finding new molecules with desired property in the vast chemical space. Among the several approaches, fragment based drug discovery (FBDD) has been effective wavy for exploring chemical space. Thanks to the effectiveness of FBDD, many molecule generative modles employ FBDD for generating plausible and diverse desired molecules. However, existing fragment extraction or motif mining have two limitations: (1) not consider the target chemical property of drug discovery, (2) depending on heuristic fragment extraction rules. For instance, random extraction, frequency based fragment extraction, and computational method which requires expensive computation and results in sbustructures hard to assemble together. To address these limitations, authors propose deep learning based goal-aware fragment extraction method, Fragment-wise Graph Information Bottleneck (FGIB), which utilize the molecular structure and their activity, referred to as structure-acitivity relation ship (SAR) by the graph information bottleneck (GIB) for identifying the important substructures given chemical property. Effectiveness of FBDD by FGIB over other methods are provided in the Figure 1 (b). For the assembling the fragments for molecular generation, this work adopts soft-actor critic (SAC) for assembly module and a genetic algorithm (GA) for the modification module. Additionally, extracting new fragments druing the generation process with updated fragments vocabulary expand the model's ability on generating molecules in the aspect of novelty and diversity.
